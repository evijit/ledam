Both parties have exercised their free will and have taken a conscious decision to part and put an end to all other litigation as well. They have also filed a joint petition for dissolution of marriage by mutual consent Under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act before the District Court.

7. Having regard to the background of the several litigations between the parties over a period of five years, background of the parties living separately for more than five years, submission of Mr. Vivek Kumar Varinder Wadhera that he has to go back to his work place in U.S.A. and also having regard to the submission of Aditi Vivek Kumar Wadhera that she has now to think of her future, we are of the view that it is a fit case to invoke our jurisdiction Under Article 142 of the Constitution of India and grant a decree of divorce by mutual consent by waiving the statutory period of waiting.

8. Therefore, the marriage between Aditi Vivek Kumar Wadhera and Vivek Kumar Wadhera stands dissolved by decree of mutual consent. HMA No. 32/2013 on the file of District & Sessions Court, Panchkula, Haryana shall stand disposed of accordingly.
