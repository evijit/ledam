Application No. 18613 of 2011 whereby the High Court declined to quash the criminal proceedings against the Appellant. The criminal proceedings arise out of Criminal Complaint No. 135 of 2011 filed in the Court of CJM, Hatras, Uttar Pradesh by the private Respondent.

2. The case of the complainant - Respondent is that the Appellant along with Arun Kumar, Accused No. 2 was supplying books to the complainant. The complainant did not make the payment for the books on the ground that the books were not of proper standard. However, the Appellant took away blank Cheque No. 115668 drawn on Canara Bank, Main Branch, Hatras from the cheque book kept in the drawer of the table of the complainant and falsely entered the amount of ` 97,552/-.

3. The Appellant sought quashing of the said complaint on the ground that the criminal complaint was a counterblast to the notice of dishonour of cheque upon which a summoning order had been passed and proceedings Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 were initiated by the Appellant. The Appellant relied on notice of dishonour, a copy of the criminal complaint No. 135 of 2010 filed on 16.10.2010 and order of the Court dated 4.11.2010. Reliance has been placed on the judgments of this Court in Eicher Tractor Ltd. and Ors. v. Harihar Singh and Anr. MANU/SC/8231/2008MANU/SC/8231/2008 : (2008) 16 SCC 763, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. v.

4. It is submitted that while it is true that in quashing proceedings, the Court could not go into disputed version, but in the present case, the proceedings are clear abuse of process of law.
