Therefore	O

this	O

we	O

it	O

that	O

The	O

The	O

if	O

We	O

proceed	O

the	O
assumption	O
that	O
the	O

to	O

this	O

do	O
not	O

the	O

that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
RDOs	O
opted	O
to	O
continue	O
in	O
the	O
specialist	O

and	O
yet	O
the	O
benefit	O
was	O
extended	O
to	O
them	O

because	O
whether	O
they	O
are	O
borne	O
on	O
the	O

The	O
question	O
that	O
arises	O
in	O
the	O
instant	O

is	O
whether	O
the	O

can	O
claim	O
to	O

must	O
depend	O
upon	O
the	O
nature	O

can	O

PW-7	O
who	O

in	O

from	O

we	O

the	O

himself	O
is	O
about	O
500-700	O

If	O
that	O
be	O
so	O
,	O
we	O
fail	O

could	O
have	O
really	O

the	O

between	O

accepted	O
this	O

of	O
the	O
prosecution	O

Then	O
the	O
learned	O
counsel	O
appearing	O
for	O
the	O
appellant	O
had	O
very	O
seriously	O
contended	O
that	O
the	O

the	O

in	O
regard	O
to	O
recovery	O
of	O
knife	O

not	O

Having	O

the	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
Panchayatdars	O
for	O
recovery	O
and	O
the	O
Investigating	O
officer	O
,	O
PW-20	O
,	O
we	O
find	O
sufficient	O
force	O
in	O
this	O
argument	O
of	O
learned	O
counsel	O
for	O
the	O
appellant	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
seen	O
that	O
the	O
shop	O
of	O
PW-17	O
is	O
about	O
1	O
1/2	O
kms	O
.	O

away	O
from	O
the	O
Police	O

in	O
question	O

there	O
were	O
many	O
other	O

in-between	O
,	O
still	O
the	O
I.O	O
.	O

decided	O
to	O
specifically	O
look	O
for	O
and	O
get	O
PW-17	O
as	O
a	O
Panchayatdar	O
for	O
the	O
recovery	O
.	O

From	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
PW-17	O
,	O
we	O
notice	O
that	O
undoubtedly	O
,	O
he	O
is	O
a	O
stock	O
witness	O
who	O
has	O
been	O
appearing	O
as	O
a	O
witness	O
for	O
recovery	O
on	O
behalf	O
of	O
the	O
prosecution	O
even	O
as	O
far	O
back	O
as	O
the	O
year	O
1965	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
very	O
cautious	O
in	O
accepting	O
his	O
evidence	O
.	O

The	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
alleged	O
recovery	O
is	O
made	O
also	O
creates	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
doubt	O
in	O
our	O
mind	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
seen	O
from	O
the	O
evidence	O
led	O
by	O
the	O
prosecution	O
that	O
at	O
every	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
accused	O
took	O
the	O
Panchayatdars	O
and	O
the	O
Police	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
prosecution	O
witnesses	O
themselves	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
thousands	O
of	O
people	O
present	O
witnessing	O
the	O
recovery	O
.	O

We	O
find	O
it	O
extremely	O
difficult	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
large	O
gathering	O
would	O
be	O
present	O
at	O
the	O
recovery	O
unless	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
village	O
had	O
already	O
come	O
to	O
know	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
such	O
a	O
recovery	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
currency	O
notes	O
were	O
allegedly	O
kept	O
in	O
a	O
damp	O
area	O
under	O
a	O
rock	O
also	O
creates	O
doubt	O
in	O
our	O
mind	O
since	O
no	O
prudent	O
man	O
would	O
conceal	O
currency	O
notes	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
place	O
.	O

Then	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
serious	O
doubt	O
about	O
the	O
recovery	O
of	O
the	O
wrist	O
watch	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
stated	O
that	O
on	O
28.5.1988	O
the	O
wrist	O
watch	O
in	O
question	O
was	O
recovered	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
hidden	O
and	O
was	O
seized	O
and	O
sealed	O
in	O
an	O
envelope	O
to	O
which	O
PWs.10	O
,	O
17	O
and	O
19	O
appended	O
their	O
signatures	O
.	O

But	O
surprisingly	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
sealed	O
packet	O
was	O
opened	O
in	O
the	O
court	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
watch	O
was	O
wrapped	O
in	O
a	O
newspaper	O
dated	O
