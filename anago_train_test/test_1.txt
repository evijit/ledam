The	O
learned	O
Additional	O
Solicitor	O
General	O
,	O
who	O
appears	O
for	O
the	O
appellant	O
,	O
contended	O
that	O
the	O
learned	O
Judge	O
of	O
the	O
Special	O
Court	O
had	O
gone	O
far	O
beyond	O
the	O
scope	O
of	O
the	O
contempt	O
jurisdiction	O
,	O
particularly	O
when	O
the	O
Court	O
held	O
that	O
on	O

of	O
the	O
documents	O
produced	O
by	O
the	O

the	O

with	O

He	O
contended	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
case	O
of	O
this	O
nature	O
what	O
is	O
important	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
party	O
verifying	O
the	O
statement	O
or	O
tendering	O
evidence	O
before	O
Court	O
should	O
be	O
doing	O
so	O
deliberately	O
and	O
to	O
his	O
knowledge	O
the	O
statement	O
must	O
be	O
false	O

He	O
drew	O
our	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
learned	O
Judge	O
had	O
noticed	O
that	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

was	O
in	O

with	O

in	O

that	O

be	O
tried	O
at	O
that	O
stage	O
when	O
the	O

passed	O
.	O

Subsequently	O
another	O
learned	O
Judge	O
who	O
tried	O
the	O
suit	O
of	O

held	O
that	O
the	O

in	O
that	O

which	O
is	O
akin	O
to	O
the	O

the	O

that	O
what	O

he	O

The	O
verification	O
of	O
facts	O
adverted	O
to	O
in	O
the	O
written	O
statement	O
is	O
not	O
made	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
personal	O

of	O
the	O

and	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

taken	O
by	O

in	O

When	O
in	O
a	O

the	O

had	O

accepted	O

but	O
in	O
the	O
suit	O
against	O
CMF	O
such	O
stand	O
had	O
been	O
dis-believed	O
,	O
it	O
becomes	O
difficult	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	O

had	O
deliberately	O
stated	O
falsehood	O
to	O
mislead	O
the	O

Where	O
a	O

nothing	O

that	O
the	O

not	O
how	O

how	O
they	O

to	O

What	O
is	O
more	O
worrisome	O
is	O
that	O
the	O

that	O

be	O

caused	O

incident	O
with	O
people	O
in	O
large	O

The	O

about	O

that	O

The	O

What	O

It	O
is	O
enough	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
state	O
that	O
Sasan	O
contends	O
that	O
it	O
