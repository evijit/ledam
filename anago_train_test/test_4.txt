The	O

all	O

The	O

that	O

We	O
must	O
repeat	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
even	O
a	O

We	O
are	O
of	O
the	O
opinion	O
that	O
in	O
such	O

the	O

can	O

The	O

therefore	O

is	O
the	O
one	O
recognised	O
and	O
reiterated	O
in	O

9-A-to	O

where	O

the	O
Court	O
should	O
decide	O
the	O

the	O

that	O

not	O
mean	O
that	O
pending	O
the	O

the	O

,	O
the	O

called	O
for	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

A	O
mere	O
objection	O

not	O
instantly	O
disable	O
the	O

The	O

It	O

that	O

our	O

:	O
1	O

That	O
HRC	O
gives	O
only	O
2	O
acres	O
of	O
land	O
to	O
each	O
displaced	O
family	O
is	O

satisfactory	O
.	O

In	O
case	O
of	O
Sardar	O
Sarovar	O
Project	O
in	O
Gujarat	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
contended	O
that	O
each	O
family	O
is	O
getting	O
2	O
hectares	O
of	O
land	O
as	O
a	O
minimum	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
logic	O
for	O
discriminating	O
against	O
the	O
project	O
affected	O
persons	O
of	O
the	O
Tehri	O
Project	O
and	O
such	O
discrimination	O
violates	O
their	O
fundamental	O
rights	O
under	O
the	O
Constitution	O
to	O
be	O
treated	O
as	O
equal	O
under	O
the	O
law	O
.	O

We	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
appropriate	O
to	O
hold	O
that	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
land	O
recommended	O
by	O
HRC	O
is	O
inadequate	O
or	O
insufficient	O
.	O

Such	O
recommendation	O
has	O
been	O
made	O
by	O
HRC	O
after	O
due	O
deliberation	O
in	O
the	O
matter	O
on	O
the	O
availability	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

the	O
life	O

of	O
the	O

needs	O

other	O
relevant	O
factors	O
in	O
this	O

Above	O
all	O
,	O
the	O
project	O

being	O
carried	O
out	O
in	O
a	O
hilly	O
area	O
where	O
land	O
is	O
very	O
scarce	O
.	O

In	O
such	O
circumstances	O
,	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
any	O
comparison	O
can	O
be	O
drawn	O
between	O
Sardar	O
Sarovar	O
Project	O
and	O
Tehri	O
Project	O

reject	O
this	O
contention	O
raised	O

2	O
.	O

Next	O
recommendation	O
in	O
respect	O
of	O
which	O
objection	O
is	O
raised	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
Government	O
of	O
India	O
has	O
chosen	O
to	O
treat	O
as	O
separate	O
families	O
sons	O
and	O
unmarried	O
daughters	O
who	O
have	O
attained	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
21	O
years	O
on	O
the	O
prescribed	O
date	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
urged	O
that	O
18	O
years	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
taken	O
as	O
the	O
age	O
for	O
such	O
classification	O
and	O
not	O
21	O
years	O
.	O

These	O
matters	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
realm	O
of	O
decision	O
of	O
the	O
recommendatory	O
body	O
and	O
the	O
Government	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
Government	O
had	O
chosen	O
any	O
other	O
age	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
held	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
Irrational	O
.	O

The	O
contention	O
that	O
voting	O
rights	O
to	O
citizens	O
had	O
been	O
given	O
even	O
at	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
18	O
years	O
has	O
no	O
relevance	O
to	O
the	O
facts	O
under	O
consideration	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
this	O
contention	O
also	O
does	O
not	O
deserve	O
our	O
intervention	O
.	O

3	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
objection	O
is	O
raised	O
in	O
regard	O
to	O
major	O
sons	O
and	O
unmarried	O
daughters	O
not	O
being	O
given	O
land	O
but	O
only	O
cash	O
and	O
is	O
not	O
acceptable	O
as	O
the	O
same	O
results	O
in	O
discrimination	O
particularly	O
once	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
recognised	O
as	O
separate	O
families	O
and	O
such	O
discrimination	O
would	O
be	O
violative	O
of	O
their	O
fundamental	O
rights	O
under	O
the	O
Constitution	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
contended	O
that	O
all	O
major	O
married	O
sons	O
should	O
be	O
given	O
2	O
hectares	O
of	O
land	O
as	O
a	O
minimum	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
benefits	O
due	O
to	O
them	O
as	O
a	O
displaced	O
family	O
under	O
the	O
package	O
and	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
given	O
the	O
option	O
of	O
taking	O
cash	O
,	O
equivalent	O
to	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
2	O
hectares	O
of	O
land	O
in	O
lieu	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
so	O
desire	O
.	O

This	O
argument	O
also	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
accepted	O
because	O
as	O
stated	O
earlier	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
scarcity	O
of	O
land	O
it	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
feasible	O
to	O
provide	O
land	O
to	O
every	O
family	O
and	O
even	O
such	O
families	O
as	O
have	O
been	O
treated	O
for	O
purposes	O
of	O
giving	O
larger	O
benefit	O
major	O
sons	O
and	O
unmarried	O

are	O
treated	O
as	O
a	O
separate	O
family	O
and	O
not	O
for	O
any	O
other	O
purposes	O
.	O

Similarly	O
other	O
contention	O
that	O
the	O
unmarried	O
sons	O
and	O
daughters	O
should	O
be	O
treated	O
as	O
a	O
half	O
a	O
family	O
unit	O

should	O
be	O
given	O
half	O
hectare	O
of	O
land	O

cash	O
in	O
lieu	O
thereof	O
,	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
accepted	O

The	O
contention	O
now	O
put	O
forth	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
lands	O

are	O

uncommon	O
where	O
a	O

Their	O
evidence	O
sometimes	O
becomes	O

in	O

so	O

It	O
was	O
noted	O
that	O
the	O
basis	O
on	O
which	O
Section	O

operates	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
a	O
person	O
makes	O
a	O
confession	O
implicating	O
himself	O
that	O
may	O
suggest	O
that	O

Section	O

that	O

however	O
that	O

be	O
adopted	O
by	O
the	O
Court	O
in	O
dealing	O
with	O
