about	O
the	O

He	O

of	O

at	O
about	O
6	O

asked	O
him	O

that	O

him	O
he	O

He	O

to	O
suspect	O

His	O
presence	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
quite	O
natural	O
since	O
a	O

to	O
be	O
held	O
concerning	O
the	O
lands	O
which	O
were	O

for	O

to	O

to	O

the	O

This	O

By	O
5	O
p.m.	O
recording	O

He	O
denied	O
the	O

that	O

mmitted	O
in	O

In	O
fact	O
that	O
was	O
no	O

is	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
PW-9	O
Shivji	O

who	O
is	O
the	O

of	O

This	O

the	O

in	O
the	O

manner	O
as	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

We	O
find	O
that	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
six	O
eye	B-LEG
tnesses	O
have	O
been	O
examined	O
by	O
the	O
prosecution	O

Nothing	O
has	O
been	O
elicited	O
in	O
their	O
cross-examination	O
which	O
may	O
lead	O
us	O
to	O
doubt	O
their	O
reliability	O
or	O
truthfulness	O

The	O
only	O
criticism	O
leveled	O
against	O
them	O
is	O
that	O
three	O
of	O
them	O

the	O

all	O
the	O

was	O

that	O

that	O
on	O
27th	O

1997	O

the	O
eye	B-LEG

,	O
even	O
the	O
investigating	O
officer	O

PW-12	O
has	O
deposed	O
that	O

were	O
not	O
willing	O
to	O
make	O

and	O
therefore	O
no	O

it	O
took	O
place	O
between	O

and	O
6.45	O
a.m.	O
in	O
the	O
heart	O
of	O
the	O

However	O
,	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
village	O
relationship	O
their	O
reluctance	O
to	O
depose	O
against	O
the	O

can	O
be	O
well	O
appreciated	O

The	O

did	O
not	O

themselves	O

in	O
this	O

The	O
eye	B-LEG

no	O

belong	O
to	O
village	O

but	O
one	O
can	O
not	O
ignore	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O

is	O
at	O
a	O
distant	O
of	O
only	O
half	O
a	O
kilometer	O
from	O

On	O
the	O
request	O
of	O
Madan	O

(	O
deceased	O

and	O
on	O
the	O
persuasion	O
of	O
the	O

these	O
witnesses	O
had	O
come	O
to	O
take	O
part	O
in	O
the	O
Panchayati	O
to	O
be	O
held	O
that	O
morning	O
.	O

They	O
can	O
not	O
therefore	O
be	O
described	O
as	O
mere	O
chance	O
witnesses	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
come	O
to	O
that	O
village	O
with	O
a	O
purpose	O
and	O
were	O
not	O
mere	O
passers	O
by	O

We	O
have	O
found	O
their	O
deposition	O
to	O
be	O
convincing	O
and	O
truthful	O

20	O
.	O

The	O
consistency	O
in	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
the	O
eye	B-LEG
tnesses	O
is	O
also	O
understandable	O
in	O
the	O
facts	O
of	O
this	O
case	O
.	O

The	O
witnesses	O
were	O
known	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
and	O
they	O
also	O
knew	O
the	O
appellants	O
and	O
their	O
victims	O
.	O

The	O
occurrence	O
took	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
sufficient	O
light	O
to	O
enable	O
the	O
witnesses	O
to	O
identify	O
the	O
appellants	O
and	O
the	O
deceased	O
.	O

The	O
assault	B-LEG
victims	O
was	O
not	O
simultaneous	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
shot	O
dead	O
one	O
after	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

The	O
witnesses	O
were	O
only	O
10	O
to	O
15	O
steps	O
behind	O
the	O
assailants	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
therefore	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
notice	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
occurrence	O
took	O
place	O
and	O
the	O
role	O
played	O
by	O
the	O
appellants	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
therefore	O
no	O
scope	O
for	O
any	O
confusion	O
in	O
the	O
mind	O
of	O
the	O
witnesses	O
.	O

Their	O
statements	O
were	O
recorded	O
immediately	O
after	O
the	O
arrival	O
of	O
the	O
Investigating	O
Officer	O
.	O

In	O
these	O
circumstances	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
the	O
prosecution	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
disbelieved	O
merely	O
because	O
the	O
testimony	O
of	O
the	O
eye	B-LEG
tnesses	O
is	O
consistent	O
by	O
raising	O
a	O
suspicion	O
that	O
they	O
may	O
be	O
got	O
up	O
or	O
tutored	O
witnesses	O

Another	O
feature	O
of	O
the	O
case	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
occurrence	O
took	O
place	O
between	O
6.30	O
and	O
6.45	O
a.m	O
.	O

Soon	O
thereafter	O
the	O
Sub-Inspector	O
of	O

a	O

after	O
making	O
an	O
entry	O
in	O
the	O
Station	O

Though	O
the	O

is	O
about	O
13	O

from	O
the	O
village	O
of	O

he	O
showed	O
great	O
promptness	O
in	O
reaching	O
the	O
village	O
of	O
occurrence	O
at	O
about	O
8-	O
8.15	O

He	O
recorded	O
the	O
statement	O
of	O
the	O
informant	O
,	O
PW-10	O
and	O
commenced	O
investigation	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
hardly	O
any	O
delay	O
in	O
lodging	O
the	O
FIR	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
opportunity	O
for	O
the	O
informant	O
to	O
concoct	O
a	O
false	O
story	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
eye	B-LEG
tnesses	O
are	O
named	O
in	O
the	O
FIR	O
and	O
their	O
presence	O
is	O
confirmed	O
by	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
their	O
statements	O
were	O
also	O
recorded	O
immediately	O
by	O
the	O
investigating	O
officer	O

Moreover	O

the	O
Superintendent	O

The	O
postmortem	O

held	O
on	O
the	O

day	O
by	O
4	O
different	O
medical	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
rare	O
case	O
where	O
we	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
investigating	O
agency	O
acted	O
with	O
great	O
promptitude	O

We	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
do	O
not	O
suspect	O
that	O
the	O

concocted	O
a	O
false	O
case	O

The	O
defence	O
set	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
appellants	O
was	O
that	O
a	O
dacoity	B-LEG
mmitted	O
in	O

on	O

In	O

e	O

The	O

the	O

came	O
to	O
the	O

we	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
conclusion	O
reached	O
by	O
the	O

below	O
is	O
fully	O
justified	O

DW-1	O
stated	O
that	O
a	O
dacoity	B-LEG
mmitted	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
deceased	O
Madan	O
Singh	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
and	O
his	O

were	O
killed	O

Many	O
people	O
had	O
assembled	O
when	O
the	O

mmitted	O
but	O
no	O
information	O
was	O
given	O
to	O
the	O

by	O
anyone	O

He	O
,	O
no	O

stated	O
that	O
Jagarnath	O

the	O
Chowkidar	O

The	O
said	O

Similar	O
assertion	O
was	O
made	O
by	O
DW-2	O
who	O

claimed	O

he	O

that	O

He	O

that	O

What	O
is	O
conspicuous	O
in	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
that	O
fact	O
that	O

The	O

No	O

that	O

We	O

no	O

Having	O
carefully	O
considered	O
the	O
evidence	O

we	O
are	O
satisfied	O
that	O
the	O
conviction	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
fully	O
justified	O
in	O
the	O
facts	O

On	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
sentence	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
submitted	O
on	O

of	O
the	O
appellants	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
appropriate	O
case	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
extreme	O
penalty	O
of	O
death	O
was	O

since	O
this	O

not	O
fall	O
in	O
the	O
category	O
of	O
the	O
rarest	O
of	O
rare	O
cases	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
four	O
innocent	O
lives	O
were	O
lost	O
and	O
the	O
act	O
of	O
the	O

was	O
certainly	O
an	O
inhuman	O
cruel	O
and	O
dastardly	O
act	O

However	O
,	O
one	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	O
matter	O
deserves	O
to	O
be	O
mentioned	O
while	O
on	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
sentence	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
disputed	O
that	O
the	O
gift	O
deed	O
was	O
executed	O
sometime	O
in	O
the	O
year	O
1987	O
which	O
gave	O
rise	O
to	O

relationship	O
between	O
Madan	O

on	O
the	O

and	O
Ram	O
Anup	O
Singh	O
and	O
his	O

on	O

There	O
is	O
evidence	O
on	O

to	O
suggest	O
that	O
several	O
Panchayatis	O
were	O
held	O
to	O
resolve	O
the	O
dispute	O
.	O

The	O
case	O
of	O
the	O
prosecution	O
is	O
that	O
Ram	O
Anup	O
Singh	O
even	O
resorted	O
to	O
litigation	O
and	O
instigated	O
Madan	O
Singh	O
to	O
file	O
a	O
Civil	O
Suit	O
against	O
his	O
son-in-law	O
for	O
cancellation	O
of	O
the	O
deed	O
of	O
gift	O

That	O
matter	O
was	O
however	O
compromised	O
and	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
thereafter	O
cordial	O
relationship	O
prevailed	O
in	O
the	O
family	O
of	O
Madan	O
Singh	O
,	O
Minor	O

between	O
Madan	O

,	O
while	O
all	O
these	O
events	O
took	O
place	O
over	O
ten	O
years	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
not	O
even	O
a	O
suggestion	O
that	O
the	O
appellants	O
ever	O
resorted	O
to	O
violence	O
or	O
that	O
any	O
untoward	O
incident	O
took	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
past	O

The	O
appellants	O
were	O
no	O

aggrieved	O
but	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
the	O
law	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O

they	O
tried	O
all	O

non	O

methods	O
available	O

them	O

including	O
litigation	O

Panchayati	O

In	O
the	O

fails	O
to	O

why	O
on	O
the	O
date	O
of	O
occurrence	O
suddenly	O
the	O
appellants	O
decided	O
to	O
do	O
away	O
with	O
all	O
the	O

The	O
High	O

has	O
also	O
considered	O
this	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
found	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
suggest	O
that	O
the	O
crime	O
perpetuated	O
by	O
the	O
appellants	O
was	O
by	O
way	O
of	O

The	O
High	O

is	O
right	O
in	O

this	O

nothing	O

We	O
have	O
therefore	O
first	O
to	O

on	O
the	O
word	O

'	O

Now	O
an	O

seldom	O
consists	O
of	O
a	O

It	O
is	O
usually	O
composed	O

several	O

,	O
as	O
a	O

a	O
whole	O

be	O

before	O
it	O

In	O
the	O

,	O
the	O

that	O
there	O

an	O

that	O

Now	O
it	O

If	O

it	O
was	O
an	O

it	O
was	O
the	O

doing	O

an	O
official	O

but	O
in	O
either	O
event	O
the	O

was	O
official	O
because	O
the	O

whatever	O

we	O

This	O

(	O

But	O
we	O
are	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
reiterated	O
that	O
those	O

also	O
had	O
undertaken	O
a	O

on	O

that	O

that	O

Mr.	O
Mahabir	O
Singh	O
,	O
learned	O
counsel	O
for	O
the	O

very	O
seriously	O
contended	O
that	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
considerable	O
delay	O
in	O
filing	O
the	O
FIR	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
complainant	O
with	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
the	O

wanted	O
to	O
include	O

on	O

He	O
also	O
contended	O
that	O
the	O
motive	O
alleged	O
by	O
the	O
prosecution	O
could	O
be	O
hardly	O
any	O
reason	O
to	O
commit	O
the	O
murder	O
.	O

Learned	O
counsel	O
also	O
contended	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
because	O
of	O
this	O
manipulation	O
that	O
the	O
prosecution	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
examine	O
any	O

though	O
admittedly	O
they	O
were	O
present	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
incident	O

He	O
also	O
contended	O
that	O

evidence	O
of	O
PWs	O

are	O
the	O
only	O
eye	B-LEG

in	O
this	O
case	O

Learned	O
counsel	O
further	O
contended	O
that	O
the	O
High	O
Court	O
has	O
seriously	O
erred	O
in	O
invoking	O
Section	O
34	O
IPC	O
to	O
convict	O
the	O
appellants	O
who	O
according	O
to	O
learned	O
counsel	O
,	O
had	O
absolutely	O
no	O
role	O
to	O

in	O
this	O

that	O
they	O

of	O
the	O

He	O
supported	O
this	O
argument	O
of	O
his	O
by	O
contending	O
that	O
though	O
originally	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
Section	O
149	O
IPC	O
which	O
was	O
invoked	O
against	O

The	O

Although	O
the	O
accused	O
have	O
alleged	O
that	O
Hanumantha	O
PW-1	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
dispute	O
over	O
money	O
and	O
land	O
with	O
the	O
deceased	O
was	O
actually	O
responsible	O
for	O
causing	O
the	O
injuries	O
sustained	O
by	O
him	O
,	O
yet	O
even	O
assuming	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
such	O
bad	O
blood	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
brothers	O
,	O
both	O
PW-1	O
and	O
his	O
mother	O
PW-4	O
would	O
have	O
in	O
the	O
ordinary	O
course	O
rushed	O
to	O
intervene	O
to	O
save	O
the	O
deceased	O
from	O
being	O
belaboured	O
.	O

No	O
such	O
attempt	O
was	O
made	O
by	O
any	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
nor	O
even	O
by	O
PW-5	O
who	O
happens	O
to	O

So	O
much	O
so	O
,	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
make	O
any	O
attempt	O
to	O
help	O
the	O
injured	O
after	O
the	O
alleged	O
assailants	O
had	O
fled	O
from	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
most	O
unnatural	O
for	O
PW-4	O
mother	O
and	O
PW-1	O
brother	O
of	O
the	O
deceased	O
to	O
return	O
home	O
leaving	O
the	O
injured	O
in	O
a	O
hapless	O
condition	O
with	O
his	O
hands	O
tied	O
behind	O
his	O
back	O
.	O

Equally	O
unnatural	O
is	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
the	O
father	O
of	O
the	O
deceased	O
who	O
along	O
with	O
PW-1	O
and	O
PW-4	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
spot	O
where	O
the	O
deceased	O
was	O
lying	O
injured	O
but	O
did	O
nothing	O
to	O
help	O
him	O
.	O

Instead	O
,	O
PW-4	O
the	O
father	O
of	O
the	O
deceased	O
leaves	O
the	O
deceased	O
in	O
a	O
critical	O
condition	O
to	O
report	O
the	O
matter	O
to	O
the	O
police	O
.	O

What	O
makes	O
the	O
entire	O
story	O
unacceptable	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
mother	O
PW-4	O
and	O
the	O
son	O
PW-1	O
wait	O
till	O
10.00	O
p.m.	O
when	O
the	O
police	O
arrive	O
to	O
untie	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
deceased	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
not	O
all	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
police	O
arrived	O
,	O
PW-1	O
presents	O
a	O
written	O
complaint	O
about	O
the	O
incident	O
.	O

His	O
statement	O
(	O
fardbeyan	O
)	O
is	O
recorded	O
by	O
the	O
Sub-Inspector	O
in	O
which	O
Basavaraj	O
is	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
died	O
,	O
meaning	O
thereby	O
that	O
Basavaraj	O
was	O
not	O
alive	O
when	O
the	O
police	O
reached	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

What	O
is	O
amazing	O
is	O
the	O
admission	O
made	O
by	O
PW-19	O
that	O
the	O
report	O
received	O
by	O
him	O
about	O
the	O
incident	O
was	O
destroyed	O
by	O
him	O
after	O
the	O
fardbeyan	O
of	O
PW-1	O
was	O
recorded	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

This	O
implies	O
that	O
the	O
first	O
version	O
regarding	O
the	O
incident	O
was	O
totally	O
obliterated	O
by	O
the	O
Investigating	O
Officer	O
and	O
Exb	O
.	O

P-1	O
recorded	O
in	O
its	O
place	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
difficult	O
to	O
appreciate	O
how	O
PW-19	O
could	O
have	O
destroyed	O
the	O
original	O
complaint	O
given	O
to	O
him	O
by	O
Hanumantha	O
PW-1	O
.	O

This	O
implies	O
that	O
the	O
earliest	O
version	O
about	O
the	O
incident	O
was	O
destroyed	O
by	O
PW-19	O
and	O
a	O
new	O
story	O
stated	O
in	O
the	O
fardbeyan	O
was	O
tailored	O
to	O
suit	O
the	O
prosecution	O
version	O
.	O

This	O
has	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
completely	O
demolishing	O
the	O
prosecution	O
case	O
and	O
rendering	O
its	O
version	O
wholly	O
unacceptable	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
inference	O
which	O
can	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
circumstances	O
,	O
be	O
drawn	O
is	O
that	O
Basavaraj	O
was	O
done	O
to	O
death	O
and	O
his	O
dead	O
body	O
left	O
at	O
the	O
spot	O
from	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
picked-up	O
by	O
the	O
police	O
after	O
they	O
arrived	O
around	O
10.00	O
p.m	O
.	O

The	O
complaint	O
presented	O
to	O
Sub-Inspector	O
perhaps	O
did	O
not	O
say	O
what	O
the	O
police	O
intended	O
to	O
present	O
as	O
its	O
case	O
.	O

The	O
same	O
was	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
destroyed	O
and	O
a	O
new	O
version	O
brought	O
in	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
which	O
Basavaraj	O
was	O
shown	O
to	O
be	O
alive	O
when	O
the	O
police	O
reached	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

The	O
fact	O
of	O
the	O
matter	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
Basavaraj	O
was	O
dead	O
when	O
his	O
brother	O
,	O
mother	O
and	O
father	O
discovered	O
the	O

The	O

vainly	O

incorrectly	O
attempted	O
to	O
justify	O
his	O
act	B-LEG
non-disclosure	O
by	O
stating	O
that	O
the	O

In	O
our	O

,	O
Regulation	O

only	O
protects	O
a	O
transaction	O
between	O
a	O
co-promoter	O
and	O
a	O
State	O

to	O
the	O

that	O

as	O
a	O

such	O

a	O

the	O

We	O
also	O
find	O
no	O
force	O
whatsoever	O
in	O
the	O
contention	O
of	O
the	O
learned	O
Counsel	O
for	O
the	O
Appellant	O
that	O
the	O
post-dated	O

forwarded	O

HSIDC	O
enclosed	O
with	O

The	O
next	O
contention	O
that	O
was	O
raised	O
by	O
the	O
Counsel	O
for	O
the	O
Appellant	O
was	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
cheques	O
presented	O
had	O
been	O
dishonoured	O
on	O
presentation	O
,	O
the	O
said	O
transaction	O
did	O
not	O
culminate	O
in	O
an	O
acquisition	B-LEG
lready	O
been	O
held	O
beyond	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
post-dated	O
cheques	O
issued	O
by	O
the	O
Appellant	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
HSIDC	O
were	O
in	O
consideration	O
of	O
the	O

ck	O
of	O
the	O
shares	O
held	O
by	O
HSIDC	O
in	O
the	O
Target	O
Company	O
.	O

The	O
Appellant	O
had	O
submitted	O
that	O
the	O
cheques	O
were	O
post-dated	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
suffering	O
from	O
a	O
liquidity	O
crunch	O
.	O

In	O
our	O
view	O
,	O
the	O
post-dated	O
cheques	O
amounted	O
to	O
a	O
promise	O
to	O
pay	O
and	O
that	O
promise	O
would	O
be	O
fulfilled	O
on	O
the	O
date	O
mentioned	O
on	O
the	O
cheque	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
this	O
promise	O
to	O
pay	O
amounted	O
to	O
a	O
sale	O
of	O
shares/equity	O
.	O

The	O
subsequent	O
dishonouring	O
of	O
the	O
post-dated	O
cheque	O
would	O
have	O
no	O

At	O
the	O

the	O
shares	O
of	O
HSIDC	O
by	O
making	O
payment	O
via	O
the	O
said	O
post-dated	O
cheques	O

The	O
Appellant	O
has	O
subsequently	O
shirked	O
his	O
responsibility	O
and	O
has	O
tried	O
to	O
slither	O
away	O
from	O
honouring	O

can	O
not	O
