would	O
be	O
a	O
dispute	O
touching	O

a	O

This	O
would	O
depend	O
on	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O

society	O
and	O
the	O
rules	O
and	O
bye	B-LEG

Ordinarily	O

if	O
a	O

it	O

it	O
may	O
be	O
that	O
it	O

a	O

to	O
construct	O

the	O

this	O

we	O
would	O

the	O
ingredients	O
of	O
Section	O

which	O
inter	O

provide	O
that	O
after	O

High	O
Court	O
may	O
declare	O
the	O

Therefore	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
ingredient	O
for	O
declaring	O
the	O
election-petitioner	O

to	O

it	O

Second	O
ingredient	O
provides	O
for	O

if	O
it	O

that	O
elected	O
candidate	O
obtained	O
more	O
than	O
10327	O

no	O

be	O
made	O
not	O

an	O

The	O
conclusion	O

that	O
