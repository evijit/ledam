We	O
have	O
already	O

the	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
distinction	O
between	O
the	O
political	O

to	O
appreciate	O
that	O

be	O
between	O

the	O
political	O

and	O
not	O
between	O

the	O

Hence	O
,	O
the	O
earlier	O
approach	O
of	O

between	O
the	O

the	O

we	O

the	O

of	O

The	O
next	O
question	O

The	O
Shetty	O

had	O
recommended	O
that	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
an	O
increase	O
in	O

age	O
from	O
60	O
to	O
62	O
years	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
opinion	O
,	O
this	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
done	O
for	O
the	O
simple	O
reason	O
that	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
retirement	O
of	O
a	O
High	O
Court	O
Judge	O
is	O
constitutionally	O
fixed	O
at	O
62	O
years	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
appropriate	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O
constitutional	O
framework	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O

,	O
to	O
have	O
an	O

,	O
of	O
a	O

logically	O
the	O
age	O
of	O

of	O
a	O
judicial	O

is	O
60	O
years	O
.	O

This	O
difference	O
is	O
appropriate	O
and	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
maintained	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
backlog	O
of	O

which	O

be	O

and	O
as	O
the	O

strength	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
increased	O
,	O
as	O
directed	O
by	O

it	O
would	O
be	O

for	O

in	O

the	O

to	O

Another	O
question	O
which	O
falls	O
for	O
consideration	O
is	O
the	O
method	O
of	O
recruitment	O
to	O

in	O
the	O

At	O
the	O

The	O
subordinate	O
judiciary	O
is	O
the	O
foundation	O
of	O
the	O
edifice	O
of	O
the	O
judicial	O
system	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
imperative	O
,	O
like	O
any	O
other	O
foundation	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
become	O
as	O
strong	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

The	O
weight	O
on	O
the	O
judicial	O
system	O
essentially	O
rests	O
on	O
the	O
subordinate	O
judiciary	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
have	O
accepted	O
the	O
recommendation	O
of	O
the	O
Shetty	O
Commission	O
which	O
will	O
result	O
in	O
the	O
increase	O
in	O
the	O
pay	O
scales	O
of	O
the	O
subordinate	O
judiciary	O
it	O
is	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
necessary	O
that	O
the	O
judicial	O
officers	O
,	O
hardworking	O
as	O
they	O
are	O
,	O
become	O
more	O

It	O
is	O
imperative	O
that	O
they	O
keep	O
abreast	O
of	O
knowledge	O
of	O
law	O
and	O
the	O
latest	O
pronouncements	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
that	O
the	O
Shetty	O
Commission	O
has	O
recommended	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
a	O
judicial	O
academy	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
necessary	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
of	O
the	O
opinion	O
that	O
there	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
certain	O
minimum	O

While	O
we	O

that	O

both	O

we	O
are	O
of	O

among	O

first	O
and	O
the	O

is	O
that	O
although	O

not	O

anyone	O

Nor	O
does	O
it	O
suggest	O
that	O
the	O

When	O
confronted	O
with	O
this	O
vital	O
omission	O
from	O
the	O
FIR	O
,	O
the	O
only	O
explanation	O
which	O
the	O
first	O

has	O
offered	O
is	O
that	O
a	O
white	O
paper	O
was	O
got	O
signed	O
by	O
somebody	O
from	O
him	O
at	O
the	O
arrival	O
of	O
the	O

village	O
.	O

We	O
can	O
not	O
possibly	O
accept	O
that	O
explanation	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
because	O
the	O
omission	O
of	O
the	O
names	O
in	O
the	O
FIR	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
lightly	O
brushed	O
aside	O
by	O
any	O
such	O
explanation	O
but	O
also	O
because	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
investigating	O
officer	O
,	O
upon	O
arrival	O
in	O
the	O
village	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
recorded	O
the	O
statement	O
of	O
the	O

about	O
the	O

If	O
that	O
were	O
so	O

there	O
is	O
no	O

why	O
the	O

the	O
delay	O
of	O
26	O
