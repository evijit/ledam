In	O
one	O

a	O
vendor	O
of	O

entered	O
into	O
a	O
so-called	O
``	O

The	O

is	O
not	O
strictly	O
one	O
of	O
a	O
firm	O

since	O
the	O
vendor	O
's	O
promise	O

in	O

have	O
prevented	O
him	O
from	O
simply	O
deciding	O

the	O
practical	O
effect	O

reasoning	O
quoted	O
above	O
could	O
apply	O
to	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
a	O

The	O
reasoning	O
gives	O
rise	O
to	O
some	O
difficulty	O
in	O
that	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
appear	O
that	O
the	O
purchaser	O
made	O
any	O
promise	O
to	O
exchange	O
contracts	O
within	O
two	O

It	O
seems	O
more	O
plausible	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
vendor	O
's	O
promise	O
had	O
become	O
binding	O
as	O
a	O
unilateral	O
contract	O
under	O

meet	O
the	O
deadline	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
promised	O
to	O
do	O
so	O

Similar	O
reasoning	O
can	O
apply	O
if	O
a	O
seller	O
of	O
land	O
promises	O
to	O
keep	O
an	O

open	O
for	O

If	O
the	O
buyer	O
makes	O
such	O
efforts	O
(	O
without	O
promising	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
)	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
arguable	O
that	O

What	O
is	O

is	O
that	O
the	O

have	O
included	O
two	O

who	O

In	O
our	O
opinion	O
,	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
these	O
beneficent	O
Rules	O
should	O
be	O
extended	O
even	O
to	O

the	O

the	O
job	O
of	O

which	O

is	O
the	O
foundation	O

which	O
the	O
