No. 2 of 2015 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 599 of 2015, which relates to protection from stray dogs on the foundation that the lives of human beings are to be saved, for they cannot be allowed to become prey to the stray dogs, yet he has been compelled to prefer an independent writ petition at the instance of the Petitioner-Association as it has been found that in the meantime many children have been affected by bite of stray dogs. He has brought on record certain newspaper clippings which show that the children have been bitten by the stray dogs and have suffered serious injuries. Learned Counsel would submit that there has to be protection for the children from the stray dogs because children become easy and innocent targets for these kind of dogs. In essence, the submission of Mr. V.K. Biju is that there has to be implementation of Sections 9(f) and 11(3)(b)(c) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and Section 438 of Kerala Municipality Act, 1994. Appreciating the submission that the children are fundamental embodiment of human race and they deserve protection from any kind of attack by the stray dogs, we are inclined to issue notice.

2. Issue notice on the writ petition, as also on the prayer for interim relief. The Registry is directed to fix a returnable date within four weeks.
